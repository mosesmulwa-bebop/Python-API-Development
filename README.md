This repo covers building a full-fledged API in Python using FastAPI. It is also implemented using the fundamentals of API design including routes, serialization/deserialization, schema validation, and models. It also includes SQL, testing with pytest, and a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub actions. It also involves Containerization using Docker

# Interactive Documentation

I also deployed the API both on Heroku and Digital Ocean. The documentation is interactive so have fun creating and deleting posts.
